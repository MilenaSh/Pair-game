    1. Create game field (4x4 boxes)
        - create 8 objects and hide them twice under boxes
    2. Game logic:
        - on click reveal the object behind box
            - if 2 boxes are open:
                - if boxes match: mark them as completed
                - if boxes don't match: wait 2 seconds and hide the boxes
                    - restrict user input
        - on all boxes matched: win message and option for new game
        - user should be able to restart the game at any point
    3. Restrictions: 
        - index.html can't be edited

---------------------------------------------------
    1. On opening the page: Create game field (4x4 boxes) should be printed in the console ( any visualization is accepted )
        - example:  x x x x
                    x x x x
                    x x x x
                    x x x x
        - create 8 objects and hide them twice under boxes
    2. Game logic:
        - user should have access to 'play' function in console requiring 2 parameters (row, column). User input should be restricted (only valid call should be accepted)
            - print the updated field in the console
            - if 2 boxes are open and does not match, print the field with them closed
        - on all boxes matched: win message and option for new game
        - user should be able to restart the game at any point calling 'restart()'
    3. Restrictions: 
        - index.html can't be edited
        - The html on the page during running should not be changed in any way apart from loading scripts/styles via code.
